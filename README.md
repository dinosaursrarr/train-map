# Train Map

Simulate and visualise the UK national railway timetable from 2012.

This code is absolute dogshit. It's testament to my skills when five years before I started working as a software engineer. But I came across it recently and was impressed it still works.

## How to run

This app is a [Processing](http://processing.org) sketch. To run it, you will need to:

- clone this repo locally
- unzip TTIS.zip. You should have four files in a directory called "TTIS". Sorry for this, but uncompressed they're too big for github.
- download and install the [Processing environment](https://processing.org/download)
- File > Open and select your local copy of the repo, from inside Processing
- Press Run

## Controls

The app features homemade UI widgets and force-directed labels.

Drag the mouse to pan. Moving the mouse shows the names of stations. Clickable controls appear when the mouse is at the bottom of the window.

Keyboard shortcuts:

- `+` (or `=`) and `-` to zoom in and out
- `[` and `]` to speed and slow time
- `b` to pause and unpause time
- `q` to invert colors
- `z` to toggle the control panel
- `x` to export the current configuration to a file
- `c` to take a screenshot
- `v` to toggle exporting movie frames
- Space bar to reset all settings
